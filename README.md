# android-notepad
An Android notepad app that I have been working on for Android devices.

The notepad app allows you to create and store multiple notes on your local device, a password is required on each note that you created.
You can save your notes by using the save button and it also automatically saved when you exit out of the application.
A hash-based encryption is used whenever you save your notes.

Here is a demo of my Android notepad
